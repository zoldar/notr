# Next things to do

List of stuff I want to implement next, before I forget it.

- [ ] more seamless add (add on escape/blur) with expand/contract behavior of the add form
- [ ] toolbar with trash icon that appears only on focus
- [ ] more seamless editing either by a dedicated contenteditable logic or an embedded editor - quil?
- [ ] support for linebreaks in rendered content
- [ ] support for links
- [ ] support for embed rendering of links
- [ ] checklists (faar)
- [ ] reminders with calendar integration / own notifications (faaaaar)
- [ ] PWA-readiness
- [ ] Tauri based native client
- [ ] cross client storage sync (requires some backend work, likely, faaar faaar away, but only at that point I might be able to migrate)
- [ ] sharing individual notes
