# Next things to do

List of stuff I want to implement next, before I forget it.

- [X] toolbar with trash icon that appears only on focus

- [x] add expand/contract behavior of the add form
- [x] support for linebreaks in rendered content
- [x] notes in masonry layout
- [x] checklists
  - [x] basic list item toggling
  - [x] reordering list items via dragging
  - [x] switching between standard content and checklist
- [ ] reminders with calendar integration / own notifications (faaaaar)
- [ ] notes text search
- [ ] cross client storage sync (requires some backend work, likely, faaar faaar away, but only at that point I might be able to migrate)
- [ ] color-coding of notes
- [ ] support for links
- [ ] dragging notes
- [ ] better styling
- [ ] support for embed rendering of links
- [ ] image embeds, maybe
