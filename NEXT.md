# Next things to do

List of stuff I want to implement next, before I forget it.

- [ ] toolbar with trash icon that appears only on focus
- [x] more seamless editing either by a dedicated contenteditable logic or an embedded editor - using https://prosemirror.net/docs/guide/
- [ ] add expand/contract behavior of the add form
- [x] support for linebreaks in rendered content
- [ ] notes in masonry layout
- [ ] notes text search
- [ ] support for links
- [ ] better styling
- [ ] checklists (faar)
- [ ] support for embed rendering of links
- [ ] reminders with calendar integration / own notifications (faaaaar)
- [ ] PWA-readiness
- [ ] Tauri based native client
- [ ] cross client storage sync (requires some backend work, likely, faaar faaar away, but only at that point I might be able to migrate)
- [ ] sharing individual notes
